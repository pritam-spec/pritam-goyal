      "content": "Despite significant volatility in global debt markets, domestic yields declined sharply last month. RBI continues to\nmake largescale purchase of government securities from the secondary market as part of its operations to infuse\nliquidity into the banking system. Indian Fixed income markets remained supported in the month of May despite\nadverse global cues. The US yields climbed higher due to fiscal worries and firmer-than-expected economic activity\ndata deferring interest rate cut expectations by the Fed. The UST 10Y yield has risen ~24 bps mom, closing the month\nof May at 4.40% (reaching highs of 4.63% during the month). Domestically, bond markets have rallied, barring the\nIndo-Pak border escalation episode. Favourable CPI inflation trends and record dividend announcement by the RBI\nsupported the bond markets, though higher than expected GDP growth print at the end of the last week weighed on\nthe bond market sentiments. The new benchmark 10Y G-sec is trading ~11 bps lower at around 6.21% since its issue.\nFPIs also continued inflows worth ~10k crores after profit booking in April.\nAverage banking system liquidity surplus stood at Rs 1.7 lakh crore till mid-month and improved to ~2.2 lakh crore till\nthe close of the month. RBI infused liquidity in the markets through Open Market Operations (OMOs) of Rs. 1.25 lakh\ncrore exceeding market estimates on OMOs pushing the yield curve lower. We expect durable liquidity in the ~Rs5-6\ntrillion range over the next few months, with the flow of funds to the banking system expected to come with a lag as\ngovernment spending picks up pace. we expect cash balances to moderate to around Rs2.7 trillion driven by debt\nbuyback and continued government spending. Money market rates eased by 30bps across the 3-month to 1-year\ntenure favouring corporates and NBFC borrowers with risk premium narrowing with large infuse of liquidity. We think\nmarket has already priced in two rate cuts both in bonds and OIS markets, also spreads compressed between the\nG-sec and corporate bonds as investors subscribed for better accrual specially in the short-medium term yield curve\ni.e. 2–5-year maturity. The narrowing spread between the US treasury and India’s G-secs (at 165 bps it has narrowed\nby roughly three-quarters) may act as a deterrent for the yields to soften further significantly further add complexity\nof Japan rising yield and inflation. It is important to disentangle whether the narrowing gap is primarily due to India’s\nimproving macroeconomic fundamentals or external developments like US monetary policy shifts. In truth, it is a\ncombination of both."

      "content": "Softening global commodity prices, above- normal rainfall expectations and probable improvement in agricultural\noutput helping headline inflation remain benign. Combined with expectations of decline in the U.S. dollar index and\nanticipated rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve create further room for monetary easing in India leading to further\ndecline in domestic yields in the coming months. We expect the Indian benchmark 10-year bond yield to trade in the\n6.10-6.30% range taking into consideration scope for a deeper rate cut cycle and continued easy liquidity."
