YTM is expressed as an annual rate. The YTM factors in\nYIELD TO MATURITY\nthe bond's current market price, par value, coupon interest rate and time to maturity.\nSIP or systematic investment plan works on the principle of making periodic investments of a fixed sum. It works similar to a recurring bank deposit. For\nSIP\ninstance, an investor may opt for an SIP that invests ` 500 every 15th of the month in an equity fund for a period of three years.\nThe NAV or the net asset value is the total asset value per unit of the mutual fund after deducting all related and permissible expenses. The NAV is\nNAV\ncalculated at the end of every business day. It is the value at which the investor enters or exits the mutual fund.\nA group of securities, usually a market index, whose performance is used as a standard or benchmark to measure investment performance of mutual\nBENCHMARK\nfunds, among other investments.

The exit load is deducted from the prevailing NAV at the time of\nEXIT LOAD\nredemption. For instance, if the NAV is ` 100 and the exit load is 1%, the redemption price would be ` 99 per unit.\nMODIFIED DURATION\nModified duration is the price sensitivity and the percentage change in price for a unit change in yield.\nStandard deviation is a statistical measure of the range of an investment's performance.

Beta of less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market.

It measures the correlation of the portfolio's returns to the\nR-SQUARED\nbenchmark's returns.\nDeveloped by Jack Treynor, the Treynor ratio (also known as the \"reward-to-volatility ratio\") attempts to measure how well an investment has\nTREYNOR RATIO\ncompensated its investors given its level of risk. The Treynor ratio relies on beta, which measures an investment's sensitivity to market\nmovements, to gauge risk.\nAUM or assets under management refers to the recent I updated cumulative market value of investments managed by a mutual fund or any investment\nAUM\nfirm.\nTRACKING ERROR\nMeans the annualized standard deviation of the difference in daily returns between the underlying index and the NAV of the Scheme.\nTRACKING DIFFERENCE\nMeans the annualized difference of daily returns between the index and the NAV of the Scheme.\nThe holdings or the portfolio is a mutual fund's latest or updated reported statement of investments/securities.

For instance, a mutual fund that aims at generat-\nNATURE OF SCHEME\ning capital appreciation by investing in stock markets is an equity fund or growth fund. Likewise, a mutual fund that aims at capital preservation by\ninvesting in debt markets is a debt fund or income fund. Each of these categories may have sub-categories.\nMutual funds invest in securities after evaluating their creditworthiness as disclosed by the ratings.
