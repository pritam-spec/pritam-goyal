In Q4FY25, the agriculture sector recorded healthy growth of 5. 4%, supported by strong agricultural output. The manufacturing sector’s growth further recovered to 4. 8% YoY from 3. 6% YoY in the previous quarter. Services sector growth remained resilient as weakness in the Trade+ segment was more than offset by strong construction activity and improvement in the Financial Services+ segment.

India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation eased to 3. 16% YoY in April 2025 from 3. 34% in the previous month. The decline in headline inflation was driven by a fall in food inflation to 2. 1% YoY in April 2025 from 2. 9% YoY in March 2025.

The Yield to Maturity or the YTM is the rate of return anticipated on a bond if held until maturity. YTM is expressed as an annual rate. The YTM factors in |\n| YIELD TO MATURITY | the bond's current market price, par value, coupon interest rate and time to maturity. SIP or systematic investment plan works on the principle of making periodic investments of a fixed sum. It works similar to a recurring bank deposit. For |\n| SIP | instance, an investor may opt for an SIP that invests ` 500 every 15th of the month in an equity fund for a period of three years. The NAV or the net asset value is the total asset value per unit of the mutual fund after deducting all related and permissible expenses. The NAV is |\n| NAV | calculated at the end of every business day. It is the value at which the investor enters or exits the mutual fund. A group of securities, usually a market index, whose performance is used as a standard or benchmark to measure investment performance of mutual |\n| BENCHMARK | funds, among other investments. Some typical benchmarks include the Nifty, Sensex, BSE200, BSE500, 10-Year Gsec. A mutual fund may have a sales charge or load at the time of entry and/or exit to compensate the distributor/agent. Entry load is charged at the time an |\n| ENTRY LOAD | investor purchases the units of a mutual fund. The entry load is added to the prevailing NAV at the time of investment. For instance, if the NAV is ` 100 and the entry load is 1 %, the investor will enter the fund at ` 101. Exit load is charged at the time an investor redeems the units of a mutual fund. The exit load is deducted from the prevailing NAV at the time of |\n| EXIT LOAD | redemption. For instance, if the NAV is ` 100 and the exit load is 1%, the redemption price would be ` 99 per unit. |\n| MODIFIED DURATION | Modified duration is the price sensitivity and the percentage change in price for a unit change in yield. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the range of an investment's performance. When a mutual fund has a high standard deviation, its means its |\n| STANDARD DEVIATION | range of performance is wide, implying greater volatility. The Sharpe Ratio, named after its founder, the Nobel Laureate William Sharpe, is a measure of risk-adjusted returns. It is calculated using |\n| SHARPE RATIO | standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Beta is a measure of an investment's volatility vis-a-vis the market. Beta of less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market. A beta |\n| BETA | of greater than 1 implies that the security's price will be more volatile than the market. R-squared measures the relationship between a portfolio and its benchmark index. It measures the correlation of the portfolio's returns to the |\n| R-SQUARED | benchmark's returns. Developed by Jack Treynor, the Treynor ratio (also known as the \"reward-to-volatility ratio\") attempts to measure how well an investment has |\n| TREYNOR RATIO | compensated its investors given its level of risk. The Treynor ratio relies on beta, which measures an investment's sensitivity to market movements, to gauge risk. AUM or assets under management refers to the recent I updated cumulative market value of investments managed by a mutual fund or any investment |\n| AUM | firm. |\n| TRACKING ERROR | Means the annualized standard deviation of the difference in daily returns between the underlying index and the NAV of the Scheme. |\n| TRACKING DIFFERENCE | Means the annualized difference of daily returns between the index and the NAV of the Scheme. The holdings or the portfolio is a mutual fund's latest or updated reported statement of investments/securities. These are usually displayed in terms |\n| HOLDINGS | of percentage to net assets or the rupee value or both. The objective is to give investors an idea of where their money is being invested by the fund manager. The investment objective and underlying investments determine the nature of the mutual fund scheme. For instance, a mutual fund that aims at generat- |\n| NATURE OF SCHEME | ing capital appreciation by investing in stock markets is an equity fund or growth fund. Likewise, a mutual fund that aims at capital preservation by investing in debt markets is a debt fund or income fund. Each of these categories may have sub-categories. Mutual funds invest in securities after evaluating their creditworthiness as disclosed by the ratings. A depiction of the mutual fund in various investments |\n| RATING PROFILE | based on their ratings becomes the rating profile of the fund. Typically, this is a feature of debt funds. |\n| IDCW | Dividend option is renamed as Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) option for all Schemes effective from April 1, 2021 Note: SEBI, vide circular dated June 30, 2009 has abolished entry load and mandated that the upfront commission to distributors will be paid by the investor directly to the distributor, based on his assessment of various factors including the service rendered by the distributor. |\n| June 2025 | Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully. |\n| Page \\| |  |\n| 15 |  |",
